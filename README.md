# Y4 Final Year Project - AI Audio Book Creator

## Description
The goal of the project is to generate audio books from files/book text where each character in the audio book has their own voice. 
Currently, there are a limited number of tools available to create audio books using AI Text To Speech, and little to none for creating an audio book with different voices for different characters. 
My aim in this project is to first use a Large Language Model (LLM) to identify characters in a book, identify their lines in the book, and choose a voice from a list of existing voices for the character.
Once that is done I then aim to use a Text To Speech (TTS) model to generate audio files of each characterâ€™s lines using the voice chosen for them. 
Finally, the audio files will be stitched together to create one audio file for the entire book.
